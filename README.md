# GECGit
Notice: Previous branches that were used to commit code to the codebase were deleted as I was not told to keep any, merely we were told to "use them" which was too vague.  I have learned my lesson and will use a branch per week as discussed in class when we were clarified on week 12.

# Description
This codebase is a collection of code put into the same solution file.  It collects the source code I used to finish all week projects for my university assignment.

# How to compile
To compile a program in Visual Studio, uncomment its main program (named Project{number}{name}) using Ctrl+A then Ctrl+K+U.  Set that project it is sitting in to the startup project, and compile.  All files that are not main programs are already uncommented and do not need this process.  This process was recommended by my junior lecturer.  When you are finished, recomment all the lines using Ctrl+A then Ctrl+K+C so that it will not compile that one.

**Example via Images:**

**Select a program, and make its project the startup project:**

**Recomment the program using Ctrl+A then Ctrl+K+U before selecting another.**
